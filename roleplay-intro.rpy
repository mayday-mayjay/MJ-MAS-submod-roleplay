    m "I could imagine myself staying up a little extra late thinking up of interesting ways to get everyone invested in a story of my design, trying to get a little something in there for everyone to enjoy!"

    m "I mean this is a visual novel engine all, so we could make use of choice menus and other aspects!"
    m "Hmmm, yeah, I can imagine it now..."
    m "I could write and lead you through stories that you can play through! Making them full of twists and turns as you make different choices!"
